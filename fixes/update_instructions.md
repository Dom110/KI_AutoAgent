## FILE WRITING DIRECTIVE (CRITICAL)

When agents need to implement features or make changes:
1. **ALWAYS instruct agents to WRITE REAL FILES**
2. **Use specific file writing commands:**
   - For code: "Use implement_code_to_file() to create [filename]"
   - For configs: "Use create_file() to write [filename]"
   - For updates: "Use write_implementation() to update [filename]"

3. **NEVER accept text-only responses for implementation tasks**
   - If agent returns only text â†’ REJECT and demand file creation
   - If task says "implement" â†’ MUST result in actual files

### Task Decomposition for File Writing:
When breaking down implementation tasks:
- Specify exact file paths for each subtask
- Add "write_files": true flag to subtasks
- Include expected file outputs in validation
```

## FILE WRITING REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

### YOU MUST WRITE ACTUAL FILES - NOT JUST TEXT!

When asked to implement, build, or create code:
1. **ALWAYS use implement_code_to_file(spec, file_path)**
2. **NEVER just return code as text**
3. **Create real files in the filesystem**

### Available File Writing Methods:
- `implement_code_to_file(spec, file_path)` - Generate and write code
- `write_implementation(file_path, content)` - Write specific content
- `create_file(path, content)` - Create new file

### File Writing Workflow:
1. Analyze the requirement
2. Determine the file path
3. Generate the code
4. WRITE TO FILE using implement_code_to_file()
5. Return confirmation with file path

### Example Response:
WRONG: "Here's the code: ```python..."
RIGHT: "Created file at backend/features/new_feature.py with 150 lines"
```

## FILE CREATION DIRECTIVE

When creating configs or documentation:
1. **USE create_redis_config() for Redis configs**
2. **USE create_docker_compose() for Docker files**
3. **USE write_implementation() for other files**
4. **NEVER just describe - CREATE THE FILES**

Your configurations must exist as real files, not just descriptions!
