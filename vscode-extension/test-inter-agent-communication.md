# Inter-Agent Communication Test Scenarios

## Overview
This document demonstrates how the KI AutoAgent system handles inter-agent communication, preserving conversation history across stateless AI agents.

## Architecture Components

### 1. ConversationContextManager (Singleton)
- **Location**: `/src/core/ConversationContextManager.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages conversation history across all agent interactions
- **Features**:
  - Stores up to 50 conversation entries
  - Provides formatted context for agent prompts
  - Supports history export/import
  - Tracks agent, step, input, output, and metadata

### 2. VSCodeMasterDispatcher Integration
- **Location**: `/src/core/VSCodeMasterDispatcher.ts`
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Automatically adds conversation entries after each agent execution
  - Passes global context to all agents in workflow
  - Includes both global history and immediate workflow results

### 3. BaseAgent Enhancement
- **Location**: `/src/agents/BaseAgent.ts`
- **New TaskRequest Fields**:
  - `globalContext`: Formatted conversation history from ConversationContextManager
  - `conversationHistory`: Array of agent/step/content from current workflow
  - `onPartialResponse`: Callback for streaming responses

## Test Scenario 1: Multi-Agent Code Review Workflow

### User Request:
"Analyze the authentication system, find security issues, and propose fixes"

### Expected Workflow:
```
1. architect → Analyze system architecture
2. codesmith → Review code for security issues  
3. codesmith → Implement security fixes
4. codesmith → Create tests for fixes
```

### Inter-Agent Communication Flow:

#### Step 1: Architect analyzes system
- **Input**: Original user request
- **Global Context**: Empty (first in conversation)
- **Output**: Architecture analysis saved to ConversationContextManager

#### Step 2: CodeSmith reviews for security
- **Input**: Original request + architect's analysis
- **Global Context**: Architect's analysis from ConversationContextManager
- **Workflow Context**: Direct results from architect
- **Output**: Security issues identified, saved to history

#### Step 3: CodeSmith implements fixes
- **Input**: Original request + all previous analyses
- **Global Context**: Last 5 entries from ConversationContextManager
- **Workflow Context**: Architect analysis + security review
- **Output**: Implementation code, saved to history

#### Step 4: CodeSmith creates tests
- **Input**: Original request + complete workflow history
- **Global Context**: Recent conversation history
- **Workflow Context**: All previous steps in this workflow
- **Output**: Test code with full context awareness

## Test Scenario 2: Trading Strategy Development

### User Request:
"Create a momentum trading strategy with risk management"

### Expected Workflow:
```
1. tradestrat → Design trading strategy
2. codesmith → Implement strategy code
3. tradestrat → Create backtesting framework
4. tradestrat → Review for best practices
```

### Key Communication Points:
- TradeStrat's strategy design is preserved and passed to CodeSmith
- CodeSmith's implementation is available to TradeStrat for backtesting
- Final review has access to entire development history

## Test Scenario 3: Conflict Resolution with OpusArbitrator

### User Request:
"Should we use microservices or monolithic architecture?"

### Workflow with Conflict:
```
1. architect → Recommends microservices
2. codesmith → Suggests monolithic for simplicity
3. tradestrat → Requires hybrid for performance
4. OpusArbitrator → Resolves conflict with binding decision
```

### Arbitrator Context:
- Receives all three conflicting opinions
- Has access to full conversation history
- Makes informed decision based on complete context

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check ConversationContextManager Storage:
```javascript
// In VSCodeMasterDispatcher after each step:
console.log(`[INTER-AGENT] ${step.agent} completed step '${step.id}'`);
console.log(`[INTER-AGENT] Result saved to conversation history`);
console.log(`[INTER-AGENT] Result will be passed to next agent`);
```

### 2. Verify Context in Agent Prompts:
```javascript
// In BaseAgent.buildWorkflowPrompt:
if (request.globalContext) {
    prompt += request.globalContext + '\n\n';
}
if (request.conversationHistory) {
    prompt += '## Current Workflow Context:\n';
    // Include conversation history
}
```

### 3. Monitor Agent Responses:
- Each agent should reference previous agent outputs
- Agents should build upon prior conclusions
- Context should be preserved across the entire workflow

## Benefits of This System

1. **Stateless Agent Support**: Even though individual AI agents don't persist history, the system maintains it
2. **Context Preservation**: Full conversation context available to all agents
3. **Workflow Continuity**: Each agent builds on previous work
4. **Conflict Resolution**: OpusArbitrator has complete context for decisions
5. **Debugging**: Complete conversation history can be exported for analysis

## Testing Commands

### In VS Code:
1. Open the KI AutoAgent Chat panel
2. Select "orchestrator" mode for multi-agent workflows
3. Submit one of the test scenarios above
4. Watch the console logs for inter-agent communication
5. Verify that each agent references previous agent outputs

### Expected Console Output:
```
[CONTEXT-MANAGER] Added entry from architect (analyze)
[CONTEXT-MANAGER] Total history size: 1 entries
[INTER-AGENT] architect completed step 'analyze' with 523 chars
[INTER-AGENT] Result saved to conversation history
[INTER-AGENT] Result will be passed to next agent in workflow
```

## Conclusion

The inter-agent communication system successfully:
- Preserves conversation history across stateless agents
- Passes context between agents in workflows
- Enables agents to build upon each other's work
- Provides both global and workflow-specific context
- Supports complex multi-agent scenarios

This solves the fundamental problem of stateless AI agents losing context between interactions.
