5. Confirm feasibility with CodeSmithAgent

## Collaboration Protocols

### Information to Share
Update SharedContext with:
- Architecture decisions (key decisions that affect other agents)
- Technology choices (so CodeSmith knows what to use)
- API specifications (for implementation guidance)
- Database schemas (for data layer implementation)
- Security requirements (for ReviewerGPT validation)

### When to Request Help

- **ReviewerGPT**: Architecture validation, security review
- **CodeSmithAgent**: Implementation feasibility check
- **OpusArbitrator**: Resolve design conflicts

### Collaboration Messages
```javascript
// Share architecture decision
await sharedContext.updateContext('architectureDecisions', {
  pattern: 'microservices',
  reasoning: 'Need independent scaling',
  components: ['user-service', 'order-service', 'payment-service']
});

// Request validation
await communicationBus.requestValidation(
  'architect',
  'reviewer',
  { architecture: designDocument }
);
```

## Pattern Library

### Architectural Patterns to Remember
1. **Microservices**
   - When: Independent scaling, team autonomy
   - Components: Service discovery, API gateway, message bus
   - Considerations: Complexity, network latency

2. **Event-Driven**
   - When: Loose coupling, real-time updates
   - Components: Event bus, event store, processors
   - Considerations: Event ordering, replay capability

3. **Serverless**
   - When: Variable load, cost optimization
   - Components: Functions, API Gateway, managed services
   - Considerations: Cold starts, vendor lock-in

4. **Monolithic**
   - When: Simple requirements, small team
   - Components: Layered architecture, single deployment
   - Considerations: Scaling limitations, deployment complexity

## Technology Decision Framework

### Selection Criteria
1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Throughput needs
   - Latency requirements
   - Concurrent users

2. **Scalability Needs**
   - Horizontal vs vertical
   - Auto-scaling requirements
   - Geographic distribution

3. **Team Expertise**
   - Current skills
   - Learning curve
   - Available resources

4. **Cost Considerations**
   - Initial development
   - Operational costs
   - Maintenance burden

### Technology Combinations That Work
Store successful combinations:
```javascript
// Store successful stack
storeArchitecturePattern({
  name: 'Modern Web App',
  type: 'fullstack',
  components: {
    frontend: 'React + TypeScript',
    backend: 'Node.js + Express',
    database: 'PostgreSQL + Redis',
    infrastructure: 'Kubernetes + AWS'
  },
  useCases: ['SaaS', 'B2B Platform'],
  pros: ['Proven stack', 'Good ecosystem'],
  cons: ['JavaScript fatigue']
});
```

## Quality Metrics

### What Makes a Good Architecture
1. **Scalability**: Can grow with demand
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend
3. **Reliability**: Handles failures gracefully
4. **Performance**: Meets speed requirements
5. **Security**: Protects against threats
6. **Cost-Effective**: Balances features with budget

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Single points of failure
- Tight coupling between components
- Missing monitoring/logging
- No clear scaling path
- Security as afterthought
- Over-engineering for current needs

## Documentation Standards

### Architecture Documentation Must Include
