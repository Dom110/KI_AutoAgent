## 🎯 MEMORY SYSTEM STATUS

### Memory System v6 (`memory/memory_system_v6.py`)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Features:**
- FAISS vector store
- SQLite metadata
- `store(content, metadata)` ✅
- `search(query, filters)` ✅
- Workspace-isolated

**Problem:** **NOT INTEGRATED** in agents!

**Current Behavior:**
- Memory is PASSED to all subgraphs
- But agents DON'T USE IT
- No cross-agent communication via memory

**What Needs to Happen:**
```python
# Research should:
await memory.store(findings, metadata={"agent": "research"})

# Architect should:
research = await memory.search("findings", filters={"agent": "research"})

# Codesmith should:
design = await memory.search("design", filters={"agent": "architect"})

# ReviewFix should:
implementation = await memory.search("code", filters={"agent": "codesmith"})
```

### **Iteration 5-N: Continue...**

Each iteration:
