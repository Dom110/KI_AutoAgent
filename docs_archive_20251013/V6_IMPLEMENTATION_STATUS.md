## üöß IN PROGRESS

### Phase 1.3: Port v5 Extensions
**Status:** READY TO IMPLEMENT
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

**Files to Port** (from git history):
1. `extensions_v6/asimov_rules.py` (from approval_manager.py)
2. `extensions_v6/predictive_learning.py`
3. `extensions_v6/curiosity_system.py`
4. `extensions_v6/tool_registry.py`
5. `extensions_v6/dynamic_workflow_manager.py`
6. `extensions_v6/neurosymbolic_reasoning.py`

**Total:** ~3500 lines to port

---

## üìã TODO (Remaining Work)

### Phase 2: Core Systems (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Learning System (`extensions_v6/learning_system.py`)
- [ ] Visualization Tools (`tools/visualization_tools.py` - Mermaid)
- [ ] Security Analysis (`tools/security_tools.py` - Semgrep)
- [ ] Quality Tools (`tools/quality_tools.py` - Radon)
- [ ] Dead Code Detection (`tools/deadcode_tools.py` - Vulture)

**Total:** ~2000 lines new code

### Phase 3: Enhance Subgraphs (12-16 hours)
- [ ] Research Subgraph (add Perplexity, Memory, Learning)
- [ ] Architect Subgraph (add Tree-sitter, Mermaid, Memory)
- [ ] Codesmith Subgraph (add validation, Memory, Asimov)
- [ ] ReviewFix Subgraph (add Security, Quality, Tree-sitter)

**Total:** ~1500 lines modifications

### Phase 4: Playground (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Implement safe code execution sandbox
- [ ] Integrate with Codesmith
- [ ] Test runner integration

**Total:** ~500 lines

### Phase 5: Testing (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests for subgraphs
- [ ] E2E test with Focus Timer app
- [ ] Manual WebSocket chat test

**Total:** ~2000 lines test code

### Phase 6: Server Enhancement (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Add event streaming to WebSocket
- [ ] Stream agent thinking, tool usage, progress
- [ ] Real-time monitoring

**Total:** ~300 lines modifications

### Phase 7: Documentation (2-4 hours)
- [ ] Complete implementation guide
- [ ] Testing report
- [ ] Migration guide

## üìä Overall Progress

### Lines of Code:
- **Completed:** ~458 lines (Tree-sitter tools)
- **Remaining:** ~9542 lines
- **Total Scope:** ~10000 lines

### Time Estimates:
- **Spent:** ~3 hours (setup, dependencies, Tree-sitter)
- **Remaining:** ~40-54 hours (full implementation)
- **Total:** ~43-57 hours (5-7 days full-time)

### Completion:
- **Phase 1:** 70% complete (server + deps + tree-sitter done, extensions pending)
- **Overall:** ~8% complete

---

## üéØ Next Actions (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session):
1. **Port Asimov Rules** (CRITICAL for security)
   - Extract from git: `approval_manager.py`
   - Adapt for v6: Async, state schemas
   - Integrate in subgraphs
   - **Time:** 2-3 hours

2. **Create Learning System** (HIGH priority)
   - SQLite-based pattern storage
   - Success/failure tracking
   - Pattern suggestion
   - **Time:** 2-3 hours

3. **Integrate Memory in Subgraphs** (CRITICAL for agent communication)
   - Research: Store findings
   - Architect: Read research, store design
   - Codesmith: Read design, store implementation
   - ReviewFix: Read implementation, store review
   - **Time:** 2-3 hours

### After That:
4. Enhance Codesmith with Tree-sitter validation
5. Add Security/Quality analysis
6. Implement Visualization
7. Build Playground
8. Comprehensive testing

## üö® Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers:
- **None** - All dependencies installed, server works

### Risks:
1. **Time:** Full implementation is 40-54 hours
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on MVP first (Asimov + Memory + basic testing)

2. **Complexity:** Porting v5 extensions requires careful adaptation
   - **Mitigation:** Test each component individually

3. **Integration:** Subgraphs need coordination with extensions
   - **Mitigation:** Clear interfaces, incremental integration

---

## üí° Recommendations

### For Next Session:

**Option A: MVP Approach** (8-12 hours)
Focus on making desktop app creation work with key features:
1. Port Asimov Rules (security)
2. Integrate Memory in subgraphs (communication)
3. Add Tree-sitter validation in Codesmith
4. Basic E2E test

**Result:** Working system with core features, can create desktop apps safely

**Option B: Continue Full Implementation** (40-54 hours)
Implement everything as planned:
- All v5 features ported
- All new systems implemented
- Complete testing suite
- Full documentation

**Result:** Production-ready v6 with all features

### My Recommendation:
**Start with Option A (MVP)**, then test desktop app creation. Based on results, decide whether to continue with full implementation or iterate on MVP.

## üìù Session Notes

### What Worked Well:
- ‚úÖ Server v6 architecture is clean and works
- ‚úÖ Dependency installation smooth
- ‚úÖ Tree-sitter integration successful

### What Was Challenging:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scope is MASSIVE (10k lines, 6 days work)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to recover v5 code from git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Many interdependencies between components

### What Was Learned:
- Tree-sitter is powerful and easy to use
- Server per-session architecture is correct
- v6 foundation is solid, just needs features

## üé¨ Conclusion

**Current State:**
- Server works ‚úÖ
- Dependencies installed ‚úÖ
- Tree-sitter implemented ‚úÖ
- Foundation is solid ‚úÖ

**Next Steps:**
- Port Asimov (2-3h)
- Add Learning System (2-3h)
- Integrate Memory (2-3h)
- Test desktop app creation (1-2h)

**Total to MVP:** ~10-12 hours

**Recommendation:** Focus on MVP in next session, test early, iterate based on results.
