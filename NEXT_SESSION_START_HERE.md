# 🚀 START HERE - Next Session

**Date Created:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Ready for proper testing
**Location:** `/Users/dominikfoert/git/KI_AutoAgent`

## ⚡ TL;DR - What You Need to Know

### The Problem:
- User asked to test KI AutoAgent by creating desktop app
- I tested v6 (development branch) instead of v5.8.0 (production)
- v6 tests passed but don't validate what's actually running
- **Need to test v5.8.0 properly**

### The Solution:
1. Read: **ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-09.md** (understand the split)
2. Read: **PROPER_TEST_PLAN.md** (know what to test)
3. Read: **TEST_FINDINGS_2025-10-09.md** (context on what was learned)
4. Execute: Proper test per plan

## 📋 Critical Files to Read (In Order)

### 1. ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-09.md
**Why:** Explains v5.8.0 vs v6 relationship
**Key Points:**
- v5.8.0 = Production (what runs when you `start.sh`)
- v6 = Development (isolated, incomplete rewrite)
- They don't work together
- v5.8.0 has all the features (Memory, Predictive, Curiosity, etc.)
- v6 only has basic workflow + Claude CLI

### 2. PROPER_TEST_PLAN.md
**Why:** User's exact requirements + how to test properly
**Key Points:**
- Create desktop app in ~/TestApps
- Monitor every 30 seconds
- Verify agent thinking/tool usage visible in chat
- Check Memory/Predictive/Curiosity are USED not just created
- Test all workflow features
- Graceful shutdown/restart

### 3. TEST_FINDINGS_2025-10-09.md
**Why:** What was learned, what went wrong, what's needed
**Key Points:**
- Initial tests were wrong (tested v6 not v5.8.0)
- WebSocket protocol issues fixed
- Outstanding questions about feature usage
- Proper test client requirements

## 🎯 What to Do Immediately

### Step 1: Understand Current State (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check what's running:
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health
# If running: Check which system (look at startup logs)

# Check backend installation:
ls -la ~/.ki_autoagent/backend/

# Should have BOTH:
# - langgraph_system/ (v5.8.0 - production)
# - workflow_v6.py + subgraphs/ (v6 - dev)
```

### Step 2: Read Architecture Analysis (10 minutes)
```bash
cat ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-09.md

# Key question to answer:
# "Which system actually runs when I start the backend?"
# Answer: v5.8.0 (langgraph_system/workflow.py)
```

### Step 3: Read Test Plan (10 minutes)
```bash
cat PROPER_TEST_PLAN.md

# Understand:
# - What user asked for
# - How to test properly
# - What monitoring is needed
# - What success looks like
```

### Step 4: Execute Test (Next Steps Below)

---

## 🧪 Immediate Action Items

### Option A: Continue Testing (Recommended)
If continuing from where I left off:

1. **Stop any running backend:**
   ```bash
   ~/.ki_autoagent/stop.sh
   ```

2. **Build proper test client:**
   - Fix WebSocket protocol (use "chat" not "message")
   - Add 30-second progress monitoring
   - Collect ALL message types
   - See PROPER_TEST_PLAN.md for full requirements

3. **Start backend fresh:**
   ```bash
   ~/.ki_autoagent/start.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/TestApps/backend_fresh.log
   ```

4. **Run desktop app test:**
   - Use Focus Timer task from PROPER_TEST_PLAN.md
   - Monitor in real-time
   - Log everything
   - Check every 30 seconds

5. **Analyze results:**
   - What appeared in chat?
   - Which features were used?
   - What files were created?
   - What DB entries exist?

### Option B: Investigate v5.8.0 First (Alternative)
If you want to understand before testing:

1. **Read v5.8.0 workflow code:**
   ```bash
   # Main orchestrator:
   less backend/langgraph_system/workflow.py

   # Look for:
   # - PersistentAgentMemory initialization
   # - PredictiveLearning integration
   # - CuriositySystem usage
   # - ToolRegistry setup
   ```

2. **Check WebSocket message handling:**
   ```bash
   # See what gets sent to clients:
   grep -A 20 "def handle_chat_message" backend/api/server_langgraph.py
   ```

3. **Then proceed to testing (Option A)**

## 🚨 Outstanding Critical Questions

These MUST be answered by testing:

### Agent Communication:
- [ ] Is agent thinking sent to WebSocket clients?
- [ ] Are tool calls visible in chat?
- [ ] What message types does v5.8.0 send?

### Feature Usage (The Big One):
- [ ] Is Memory actually used or just initialized?
- [ ] Are predictions made and logged?
- [ ] Are novelty scores calculated?
- [ ] Does workflow adapt to task type?

### Documentation:
- [ ] Are architecture MD files created?
- [ ] Where are they saved?
- [ ] What format/content?

### Code Analysis:
- [ ] Tree-sitter integration exists?
- [ ] Deadcode detection works?
- [ ] System architecture scans happen?

├── DesktopApp/                    # Where app gets created
│   └── .ki_autoagent_ws/          # Workspace data
└── test_*.py                      # Test clients
```

### Key Commands:
```bash
# Start/stop:
~/.ki_autoagent/start.sh
~/.ki_autoagent/stop.sh
~/.ki_autoagent/status.sh

# Check health:
curl http://localhost:8001/health

# View logs:
tail -f ~/.ki_autoagent/logs/backend.log

# Monitor files:
watch -n 5 'find ~/TestApps/DesktopApp -type f'
```

### WebSocket Protocol (Correct):
```python
# Connect
ws.connect("ws://localhost:8001/ws/chat")

# Init
ws.send({"type": "init", "workspace_path": "..."})

# Chat
ws.send({"type": "chat", "content": "..."})

# Receive (types):
# - "connected"
# - "initialized"
# - "agent_message"
# - "agent_thinking"
# - "tool_use"
# - "status"
# - "result"
# - "error"
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

By end of next session, should have:

### Documentation:
- [ ] Complete conversation log (WebSocket messages)
- [ ] Feature usage evidence (screenshots/logs)
- [ ] File tree of created desktop app
- [ ] Database dumps showing data
- [ ] Comprehensive test report

### Answers:
- [ ] Which features are actually USED in v5.8.0
- [ ] What appears in chat (thinking? tools? progress?)
- [ ] What files get created (architecture MD? scans?)
- [ ] How Memory/Predictive/Curiosity manifest

### Recommendations:
- [ ] What works well
- [ ] What's broken
- [ ] What needs fixing
- [ ] Whether to fix v5.8.0 or complete v6

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't assume features work** - Code existing ≠ code being used
2. **Monitor in real-time** - Don't wait for completion
3. **Check databases** - Memory/Learning data should be stored
4. **Read server code** - See what messages it sends
5. **Test incrementally** - One feature at a time
6. **Document everything** - You'll need it for decisions

## ❓ If You're Confused

**Q: Which system should I test?**
A: v5.8.0 (langgraph_system/workflow.py) - It's what actually runs!

**Q: But v6 tests passed?**
A: Yes, but v6 isn't used in production. It's an incomplete rewrite.

**Q: What's the relationship?**
A: They're separate. v5.8.0 = production. v6 = experimental.

**Q: Which has more features?**
A: v5.8.0 (Memory, Predictive, Curiosity, etc.)
   v6 only has basic workflow + Claude CLI.

**Q: What should I test?**
A: v5.8.0 via WebSocket chat, per PROPER_TEST_PLAN.md
