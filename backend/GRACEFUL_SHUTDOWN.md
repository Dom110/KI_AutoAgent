# ðŸ›‘ Graceful Shutdown System for KI_AutoAgent Backend

## Overview
The backend now supports graceful shutdown without killing Python processes, which prevents extension crashes.

## Features

### 1. HTTP Shutdown Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/shutdown`
- **Description**: Initiates a graceful shutdown of the backend server
- **Response**: `{"message": "Server shutdown initiated", "status": "success"}`

### 2. VS Code Extension Integration
The BackendManager already supports graceful shutdown:
```typescript
// vscode-extension/src/backend/BackendManager.ts
public async stopBackend(force: boolean = false): Promise<void> {
    // Sends SIGTERM first (graceful)
    // Waits 5 seconds
    // Falls back to SIGKILL if needed
}
```

### 3. Shutdown Process
When shutdown is initiated:
1. All WebSocket clients receive shutdown notification
2. Active tasks are cancelled with proper cleanup
3. Server terminates after sending final response
4. No abrupt process killing - prevents extension crashes

## Usage

### Via HTTP API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/shutdown
```

### Via VS Code Extension:
Use the BackendManager's `stopBackend()` method - already integrated

### Via Signal (existing):
The backend also responds to SIGTERM for graceful shutdown

## Important Notes
- **Never use `kill -9` or SIGKILL** on the Python backend process
- Always prefer graceful shutdown methods
- The shutdown endpoint requires server restart to activate (added in v4.0.30)

## Benefits
1. âœ… No extension crashes from killed processes
2. âœ… Clean resource cleanup
3. âœ… Proper client disconnection
4. âœ… Task cancellation before shutdown
5. âœ… Maintains system stability
