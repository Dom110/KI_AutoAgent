# Test Workflow UI Features

## Test Checklist

This document verifies all implemented features are working correctly.

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Collapsible Workflow Steps UI**
   - Location: `/vscode-extension/src/ui/MultiAgentChatPanel.ts`
   - Features:
     - Workflow container initialization
     - Step-by-step tracking with collapsible content
     - Toggle functionality for each step
     - Progress indicators

2. **Final Result in New Bubble**
   - Location: `/vscode-extension/src/ui/webview/chat.js`
   - Features:
     - Final result appears at end of conversation
     - Separate bubble from workflow steps
     - Clear visual distinction

3. **System Intelligence Integration**
   - Location: `/vscode-extension/src/core/VSCodeMasterDispatcher.ts`
   - Features:
     - System knowledge loaded at startup
     - Passed to agents during workflow execution
     - Pattern matching and reuse

4. **Automatic Versioning**
   - Location: `/vscode-extension/src/utils/AutoVersioning.ts`
   - Features:
     - Watches for code changes
     - Calculates semantic version based on commits
     - Updates package.json and CHANGELOG.md
     - Triggers DocuBot automatically

5. **CSS Styling**
   - Location: `/vscode-extension/src/ui/webview/chat-fixed.css`
   - Features:
     - Workflow container styling
     - Collapsible animations
     - Final result bubble styling

## How to Test

### 1. Test Workflow UI
```
1. Open VS Code with the extension
2. Open KI AutoAgent Chat (use command palette)
3. Select "auto" mode
4. Type a request that triggers multiple agents:
   "Create a new feature for user authentication"
5. Observe:
   - Workflow steps appear with 🔄 icon
   - Each step is collapsible (click to expand/collapse)
   - Final result appears in new bubble at the end
```

### 2. Test System Intelligence
```
1. The system should analyze the codebase on first run
2. Check console logs for:
   "[DISPATCHER] System Knowledge loaded: X components"
3. Subsequent requests should use learned patterns
```

### 3. Test Auto-Versioning
```
1. Make a code change to any .ts, .js, .py file
2. Wait 5 seconds (debounce timer)
3. Check for:
   - Version update notification
   - Updated package.json
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md
   - DocuBot activation
```

## Expected Workflow Display

```

## Troubleshooting

If features aren't working:

1. **Workflow steps not appearing:**
   - Check that workflow notifications contain the pattern: `🔄 **Step X/Y**: @agent`
   - Verify MultiAgentChatPanel._updateStreamingMessage() is detecting the pattern

2. **Final result not in new bubble:**
   - Ensure _createFinalResultBubble() is called when workflow completes
   - Check that webview receives 'addFinalResult' message

3. **Auto-versioning not triggering:**
   - Verify file watcher is active (check console for "[AUTO-VERSION]" logs)
   - Ensure file changes are in watched extensions (.ts, .js, .py, .tsx, .jsx)

4. **System Intelligence not loading:**
   - Check for SystemMemory initialization errors
   - Verify system analysis has run at least once

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Workflow steps display with collapsible UI
- [ ] Each step can be expanded/collapsed independently
- [ ] Final result appears in separate bubble at end
- [ ] System Intelligence loads and provides context
- [ ] Auto-versioning triggers on code changes
- [ ] DocuBot activates automatically for documentation
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Extension activates without errors
