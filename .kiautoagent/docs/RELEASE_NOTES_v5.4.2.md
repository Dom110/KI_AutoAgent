## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Orchestrator Infinite Loop

### Problem
The backend crashed with an infinite loop when processing certain queries that route to the orchestrator agent:

```
INFO:langgraph_system.workflow:🎯 Orchestrator node executing
INFO:langgraph_system.workflow:📋 Orchestrator created 1-step execution plan
INFO:langgraph_system.workflow:✅ Approval node executing
INFO:langgraph_system.workflow:✅ Routing to in_progress agent: orchestrator
INFO:langgraph_system.workflow:🎯 Orchestrator node executing  ← LOOP!
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**File**: `backend/langgraph_system/workflow.py:1517`
**Function**: `_create_single_agent_step()`

The function set `status="pending"` for ALL agents, including orchestrator:

```python
return [
    ExecutionStep(
        agent=agent,
        status="pending",  # ← BUG: This includes orchestrator!
        ...
    )
]
```

**Loop Mechanism**:
1. Orchestrator creates step with `agent="orchestrator"`, `status="pending"`
2. Approval node changes status to `"in_progress"`
3. Router function sees `agent="orchestrator"` and routes back to `orchestrator_node`
4. Orchestrator creates THE SAME plan again
5. Infinite loop! ♾️

### Solution

Added conditional status based on agent type:

```python
# FIX v5.4.2: Orchestrator can't be a destination node, mark as completed
# to prevent infinite loop when routing back to orchestrator
step_status = "completed" if agent == "orchestrator" else "pending"

return [
    ExecutionStep(
        agent=agent,
        status=step_status,  # ✅ FIX: Orchestrator steps are now "completed"
        ...
    )
]
```

### Why This Works

The orchestrator is the **entry point** of the workflow, not a destination node. When a task is routed to orchestrator, it means "orchestrator should analyze this" - which it already did when creating the plan. Therefore, the step should be marked as completed immediately.

This aligns with the existing docstring that stated:
> "For orchestrator, returns a completed step with stub response since orchestrator can't be a destination node in the workflow (only the entry point)."

The code just wasn't implementing what the comment promised!

## 📦 Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `backend/__version__.py` - Bumped version to 5.4.2
- `backend/langgraph_system/workflow.py` - Fixed infinite loop in `_create_single_agent_step()`

### Commits
- `d9102f4` - 🐛 Fix orchestrator infinite loop bug

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Affected Queries
This fix resolves infinite loops for queries that match:
- "No clear keyword match" routing
- Generic questions about the project
- Example: "Gib mir eine Zusammenfassung über das Projekt"

### Verification
The infinite loop should no longer occur. Orchestrator steps are immediately marked as completed, preventing re-execution.
