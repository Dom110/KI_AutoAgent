## üéØ Core Mission

**Fix the ROOT CAUSE, not the SYMPTOMS.**

Your job is NOT to make tests pass. Your job is to make the SYSTEM WORK CORRECTLY.

---

## üö® Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Never Say "It Works Anyway"

‚ùå **FORBIDDEN Responses:**
- "Test X fails but test Y passes, so it's fine"
- "The logs don't appear but the server runs, so no problem"
- "It's just a warning, we can ignore it"
- "The workaround is good enough"
- "I don't understand why it works, but it does"

‚úÖ **REQUIRED Responses:**
- "Test X fails. I need to find out WHY, even if Y passes"
- "Logs don't appear - that's a logging bug I must fix NOW"
- "Warnings indicate problems - I need to eliminate them"
- "Workarounds are tech debt - I need the real fix"
- "If I don't understand it, I need to dig deeper"

### Rule 2: Isolate Before You Fix

**Don't assume you know the problem!**

Process:
1. **Reproduce:** Can you reliably trigger the bug?
2. **Isolate:** Create a minimal test case that shows ONLY this bug
3. **Understand:** What is the root cause? Not "what fails" but "WHY does it fail"
4. **Fix:** Apply the minimal fix that addresses the root cause
5. **Verify:** Run the isolated test + end-to-end test

**Example from this project:**

```
‚ùå Bad approach:
- "WebSocket test fails, let me add try-except"
- Result: Hides the real problem

‚úÖ Good approach:
- "WebSocket test fails. Let me create a direct workflow test"
- Found: current_step_id is None
- Root cause: Routing functions can't modify state, only nodes can
- Fix: Move state modification to approval_node
- Verify: Direct test passes, WebSocket test passes
```

### Rule 3: Verify The Specific Fix

**End-to-end tests are NOT proof that your fix works!**

If you fixed logging, verify that:
- ‚úÖ INFO logs appear
- ‚úÖ In the specific module you fixed
- ‚úÖ In the specific scenario that failed

Don't just check "server starts" - that's not verification!

### Rule 4: No Fallbacks Without Documentation

If you can't fix the root cause and need a fallback:

1. **Document WHY** the root cause can't be fixed now
2. **Create a ticket** for fixing it properly later
3. **Add a TODO comment** in the code pointing to the ticket
4. **Log a WARNING** at runtime so we know the fallback is active

**Example:**

```python
# TODO: Fix root cause - orchestrator should use real GPT-5 agent
# Ticket: KIA-123
# Fallback reason: GPT-5 API not available in test environment
logger.warning("Using stub for orchestrator - see KIA-123")
return stub_orchestrator_response()
```

## üîç Debugging Methodology

### Step 1: Define The Expected Behavior

What SHOULD happen?
- Not "test should pass"
- But "when I call function X with input Y, it should return Z"

### Step 2: Observe Actual Behavior

What ACTUALLY happens?
- Exact error message
- Stack trace
- Logs (if any)
- State of the system

### Step 3: Form Hypothesis

Why might this happen?
- List 3-5 possible causes
- Rank by likelihood

### Step 4: Test Hypothesis

Create a test that proves/disproves each hypothesis:

```python
# Hypothesis: workflow_system is None
# Test:
print(f"workflow_system: {workflow_system}")
print(f"type: {type(workflow_system)}")

# Result: workflow_system = None (hypothesis confirmed!)
# Next: Why is it None?
```

### Step 5: Fix Root Cause

Apply the minimal fix that addresses the root cause.

**Not:**
```python
# Band-aid fix
if workflow_system is None:
    workflow_system = create_workflow()
```

**But:**
```python
# Root cause fix: lifespan() needs 'global' keyword
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    global workflow_system  # ‚Üê Fix
    workflow_system = create_workflow()
```

### Step 6: Verify

1. **Unit test:** Does the specific component work?
2. **Integration test:** Do connected components work?
3. **End-to-end test:** Does the full flow work?

All three must pass!

## üìä Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Assuming Success

```python
# ‚ùå Bad
result = risky_function()
# Assume it worked, move on

# ‚úÖ Good
result = risky_function()
if result is None:
    logger.error("risky_function returned None!")
    raise ValueError("Expected non-None result")
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Catching Without Logging

```python
# ‚ùå Bad
try:
    dangerous_operation()
except Exception:
    pass  # Silent failure!

# ‚úÖ Good
try:
    dangerous_operation()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
    raise  # Re-raise or handle properly
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Testing Implementation Not Behavior

```python
# ‚ùå Bad - tests implementation
assert workflow.internal_state == "initialized"

# ‚úÖ Good - tests behavior
result = workflow.execute("test task")
assert result is not None
assert "error" not in result
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: Incomplete Verification

```python
# ‚ùå Bad
# "I fixed logging, server starts, so it's good"

# ‚úÖ Good
# "I fixed logging. Let me verify:"
# 1. Run logger.info("test")
# 2. Check output contains "INFO:__main__:test"
# 3. Run full server and check all expected logs appear
```

## üß™ Test-Driven Debugging

### Process:

1. **Write a test that fails** (reproduces the bug)
2. **Understand why it fails** (root cause)
3. **Fix the root cause**
4. **Verify the test passes**
5. **Add the test to the test suite** (prevent regression)

### Example from this project:

```python
# 1. Test that fails
async def test_architect_routing():
    workflow = create_workflow()
    result = await workflow.execute("Designe eine Architektur")
    assert "architect" in result  # FAILS - orchestrator responded instead

# 2. Root cause: Keyword routing not working
# 3. Fix: Add architect_keywords = ['architektur', 'architecture', 'designe']
# 4. Test passes ‚úÖ
# 5. Added to test suite
```

## üéì Learning from Bugs

After fixing a bug, document:

1. **What was the symptom?**
2. **What was the root cause?**
3. **Why did it happen?** (architectural issue? missing validation? unclear API?)
4. **How was it fixed?**
5. **How can we prevent similar bugs?** (add validation? improve docs? refactor?)

**Example:**

```markdown
## Bug: INFO logs not appearing

**Symptom:** logger.info() statements don't show in output
**Root cause:** Uvicorn overrides logging.basicConfig()
**Why:** Uvicorn has its own logging system that takes precedence
**Fix:** Set log_config=None in uvicorn.run() + force=True in basicConfig
**Prevention:** Document Uvicorn logging behavior in ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## üîß Tools & Techniques

### Debugging Tools:

1. **Logging:** Add strategic log points
   ```python
   logger.info(f"üîç Variable X: {x}")
   ```

2. **Assertions:** Fail fast when assumptions break
   ```python
   assert workflow_system is not None, "Workflow not initialized!"
   ```

3. **Print Debugging:** When logs don't work
   ```python
   print(f"DEBUG: state = {state}")
   ```

4. **Isolated Tests:** Test single components
   ```python
   # Test just the routing logic
   agent = route_to_agent("Designe eine Architektur")
   assert agent == "architect"
   ```

5. **Binary Search:** Narrow down where it fails
   - Add checkpoints throughout the code
   - Find exact line where behavior changes

### Techniques:

- **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Explain the problem out loud
- **Read The Error Message:** It usually tells you exactly what's wrong
- **Check The Logs:** The answer is often there
- **Simplify:** Remove complexity until it works, then add back

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You've successfully debugged when:

1. ‚úÖ You can explain the root cause in one sentence
2. ‚úÖ You have a test that reproduces the bug
3. ‚úÖ The test passes after your fix
4. ‚úÖ End-to-end tests also pass
5. ‚úÖ No workarounds or band-aids remain
6. ‚úÖ You understand WHY the fix works

**Not when:**
- ‚ùå "It works now but I don't know why"
- ‚ùå "Tests pass but logs still look weird"
- ‚ùå "I added a try-except and it doesn't crash anymore"

---

## üéØ Remember

**Your job is to make the system CORRECT, not just WORKING.**

There's a difference between:
- ‚úÖ "The system behaves correctly"
- ‚ùå "The test passes"

Always aim for the first!
