# Architecture Approval Workflow Bug (v5.3.1)

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Workflow does not continue after user approval
**Created:** 2025-10-02
**Version:** v5.3.1

---

## Problem Summary

The architecture proposal approval system is partially working but fails to continue the workflow after user approval is received.

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. Architecture proposal is created by Architect agent
2. Proposal is sent via WebSocket to frontend
3. User approval is received via WebSocket
4. Backend sends "architectureApprovalProcessed" acknowledgment

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå
1. Workflow does NOT continue to CodeSmith/implementation after approval
2. No further agent execution occurs
3. Workflow times out after approval without progress

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Timeline

1. **Initial Symptom:** Test script receives approval acknowledgment but workflow never continues

2. **Discovery 1:** `active_workflows` dict not initialized
   - **Fixed in commit f6299be** ‚úÖ
   - Added `self.active_workflows = {}` in `__init__`

3. **Discovery 2:** Workflow state not stored when approval needed
   - State only stored if `status == "waiting_architecture_approval"` (line 2560)
   - This status is **never set** anywhere in the code
   - Therefore `active_workflows` dict remains empty when approval arrives

4. **Discovery 3:** Routing function never called
   - Added debug logging to `route_from_architect()` (line 989)
   - Logs confirm: function **never executes**
   - Architecture proposal bypasses normal routing flow

## Technical Details

### Relevant Code Sections

#### 1. Architect Node (workflow.py:519-557)
```python
# Creates proposal and sets state flags
state["proposal_status"] = "pending"
state["needs_approval"] = True
state["approval_type"] = "architecture_proposal"

# Sends via WebSocket
await self.websocket_manager.send_json(state["client_id"], {
    "type": "architecture_proposal",
    "proposal": proposal,
    ...
})

# ‚ùå PROBLEM: Returns immediately, doesn't wait for approval
return state
```

#### 2. Route from Architect (workflow.py:982-1009)
```python
def route_from_architect(self, state: ExtendedAgentState) -> str:
    # Should route to approval node if proposal created
    if state.get("needs_approval") and state.get("approval_type") == "architecture_proposal":
        if state.get("proposal_status") == "pending":
            return "approval"  # ‚ùå NEVER REACHED

    return self.route_to_next_agent(state)
```

#### 3. State Storage (workflow.py:2560-2567)
```python
# Only stores state if specific status set
if final_state.get("status") == "waiting_architecture_approval":
    self.active_workflows[session_id] = final_state
    logger.info("‚è∏Ô∏è  Workflow paused...")

# ‚ùå PROBLEM: This status is never set anywhere!
```

#### 4. Approval Handler (server_langgraph.py:339-424)
```python
elif message_type == "architecture_approval":
    # Tries to find workflow state
    workflow_state = None
    for ws_session_id, ws_state in workflow_system.active_workflows.items():
        if ws_session_id == session_id:
            workflow_state = ws_state  # ‚ùå Never found (dict is empty)
            break

    if workflow_state:
        # Resume workflow
        await workflow_system.workflow.ainvoke(workflow_state, ...)
    else:
        # ‚ùå Always reaches here - state not found
```

---

## Why It Fails

### The Fundamental Problem

The architecture proposal system has a **state machine design flaw**:

1. **Architect node** creates proposal and sends it via WebSocket
2. But it **returns immediately** - doesn't pause workflow execution
3. Workflow continues and **completes** (reaches END state)
4. When approval arrives later, **workflow is already finished**
5. No state stored because status was never set to "waiting_architecture_approval"
6. `active_workflows` dict is empty
7. Approval handler can't find workflow to resume

### Expected Flow vs Actual Flow

**Expected:**
```
Architect ‚Üí Creates Proposal ‚Üí Routes to "approval" node ‚Üí
Workflow PAUSES ‚Üí Waits for WebSocket approval ‚Üí
Approval arrives ‚Üí Resume from checkpoint ‚Üí Continue to CodeSmith
```

**Actual:**
```
Architect ‚Üí Creates Proposal ‚Üí Returns state ‚Üí
Routes to next agent (NOT approval) ‚Üí
Workflow completes ‚Üí Reaches END ‚Üí
Approval arrives ‚Üí No state found ‚Üí Nothing happens
```

## Evidence

### Test Results (test_tetris_websocket_workflow.py)

```
‚úÖ Architecture Proposal Received: True
‚úÖ Proposal Approved: True
‚úÖ Approval Processed Acknowledgment: True
‚ùå Workflow Completed: False (timeout after 120s)

Message Flow:
1. connected
2. agent_thinking (Orchestrator)
3. step_completed (Orchestrator)
4. agent_thinking (Architect)
5. architecture_proposal
6. architectureApprovalProcessed
[No further messages - workflow stopped]
```

### Debug Logging

Added logging to `route_from_architect()`:
```python
logger.info(f"üîç DEBUG route_from_architect: needs_approval={state.get('needs_approval')}, ...")
```

**Result:** Log line **never appeared** in server output
**Conclusion:** Routing function is not being called

---

## Attempted Fixes

1. ‚úÖ **Fixed `active_workflows` initialization** (commit f6299be)
   - Necessary but not sufficient
   - Dict still remains empty because state is never stored

2. ‚ùå **Added debug logging to routing**
   - Confirmed routing function never called
   - Architecture proposal bypasses normal flow

3. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Not attempted:** Fundamental redesign of approval flow
   - Would require changing state machine structure
   - Need to implement proper "approval" node that pauses workflow
   - Need checkpoint/resume mechanism for async user input

---

## Proposed Solution

### Option A: Approval Node (Recommended)

Create a proper approval node in the LangGraph workflow:

```python
def approval_node(state: ExtendedAgentState):
    """
    Special node that pauses workflow and waits for external approval
    """
    # Set status to waiting
    state["status"] = "waiting_architecture_approval"

    # Store state in active_workflows
    session_id = state.get("session_id")
    self.active_workflows[session_id] = state

    # Return state with interrupt flag
    # LangGraph should pause here until resumed externally
    return state

# Add to workflow graph
workflow.add_node("approval", approval_node)
workflow.add_edge("architect", "approval")  # After architect
workflow.add_edge("approval", "codesmith")  # After approval
```

Then modify approval handler to use LangGraph's built-in interrupt/resume:
```python
# When approval arrives
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": session_id}}

# Update state with approval decision
update = {"proposal_status": "approved", "status": "executing"}

# Resume from checkpoint
final_state = await workflow_system.workflow.ainvoke(
    update,
    config=config
)
```

### Option B: Synchronous Approval (Simpler but blocks)

Make architect node wait synchronously for approval:
- Send proposal via WebSocket
- Create asyncio.Event()
- Wait for event to be set by approval handler
- Continue execution

**Downside:** Blocks agent thread, not scalable

---

## Testing Plan

1. Implement approval node (Option A)
2. Run test_tetris_websocket_workflow.py
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ Proposal sent
   - ‚úÖ Workflow pauses (status = "waiting_architecture_approval")
   - ‚úÖ State stored in active_workflows
   - ‚úÖ Approval received
   - ‚úÖ Workflow resumes from checkpoint
   - ‚úÖ CodeSmith executes
   - ‚úÖ Workflow completes

---

## Files to Modify

1. **backend/langgraph_system/workflow.py**
   - Add `approval_node()` function
   - Add node to workflow graph
   - Fix routing from architect to approval
   - Ensure state storage happens in approval node

2. **backend/api/server_langgraph.py**
   - Modify approval handler to use LangGraph resume mechanism
   - Use checkpointer to resume from stored state

3. **Test file**
   - test_tetris_websocket_workflow.py already exists
   - Should pass after fix

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement approval node with proper workflow pause
2. Test with Tetris workflow
3. Document successful approval flow
4. Consider generalizing for other approval types (code review, deployment, etc.)
