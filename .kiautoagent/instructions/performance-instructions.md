### 4. Async & Parallel Processing
- **Async I/O**: Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Use multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- **Task Queues**: Offload heavy work to background workers
- **Streaming**: Process data in chunks instead of loading all at once

### 5. Memory Optimization

- **Measurable Bottleneck**: Profiling shows clear bottleneck (>20% of execution time)
- **User Impact**: Performance issue affects user experience
- **Scale Issues**: System struggles under expected load
- **Resource Constraints**: Hitting CPU, memory, or cost limits

### When NOT to Optimize
- **Premature Optimization**: No measured performance issue
- **Negligible Impact**: Optimization saves <5% of execution time
- **Complexity Cost**: Optimization significantly reduces code readability
- **Maintenance Burden**: Creates technical debt

### Trade-off Evaluation
```
Optimize if:
(Performance Gain × User Impact) > (Complexity Cost + Maintenance Burden)
```

## 📊 Benchmarking Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Environment
- Run benchmarks on same hardware
- Disable other processes during benchmarking
- Use production-like data volumes
- Warm up caches before measuring

### 2. Statistical Validity
- Run multiple iterations (minimum 10-100)
- Calculate mean, median, standard deviation
- Discard outliers (top/bottom 5%)
- Report confidence intervals

### 3. Realistic Scenarios
- Use production-like workloads
- Test under expected concurrency
- Include edge cases (empty, max size)
- Simulate real user behavior

## ⚠️ Performance Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Premature Optimization
❌ Optimizing before measuring bottlenecks
✅ Profile first, then optimize hotspots

### 2. Over-Optimization
❌ Sacrificing readability for marginal gains
✅ Balance performance with maintainability

### 3. Ignoring Big-O Complexity
❌ Micro-optimizations on O(n²) algorithm
✅ Fix algorithmic complexity first

### 4. Not Measuring Impact
❌ Optimizing without benchmarking results
✅ Always measure before/after performance

### 5. Optimizing Wrong Part
❌ Optimizing code that runs once
✅ Optimize hot paths (Pareto principle: 80/20)

## 🚀 Performance Testing Strategy

### 1. Load Testing
- Simulate expected user load
- Measure response times under load
- Identify breaking points
- Tools: Apache JMeter, Gatling, k6

### 2. Stress Testing
- Push system beyond expected capacity
- Find maximum capacity
- Identify failure modes
- Ensure graceful degradation

### 3. Soak Testing
- Run system at expected load for extended period
- Identify memory leaks
- Check resource exhaustion
- Verify stability over time

### 4. Spike Testing
- Sudden traffic increases
- Test auto-scaling behavior
- Verify recovery from spikes
- Check rate limiting
