# KI AutoAgent Proper Test Plan
**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Target:** v5.8.0 Production System (what's actually running)

## üéØ User Requirements (What to Test)

Based on user's explicit instructions:

### 1. Desktop App Creation via Chat Mode
- Create desktop app in `~/TestApps/DesktopApp`
- Use install script to install backend
- Use chat mode to communicate with agent
- Monitor logs throughout

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring
- **Every 30 seconds** show progress in chat
- Report what agent is doing
- Show intermediate results
- Don't just wait for completion

### 3. Agent Communication Visibility
**Critical Question:** Do agents send their thinking to chat?
- ‚úÖ Expected: See agent internal thoughts
- ‚úÖ Expected: See tool calls with arguments
- ‚úÖ Expected: See decision-making process
- ‚ùå NOT just final results

### 4. Feature Usage Verification
Test that systems are **USED**, not just created:

#### Memory System:
- ‚ùì Are previous conversations stored?
- ‚ùì Are they retrieved in new requests?
- ‚ùì Can agent reference past work?

#### Predictive Learning:
- ‚ùì Does agent make predictions before actions?
- ‚ùì Does it compare prediction vs reality?
- ‚ùì Does it learn from prediction errors?

#### Curiosity System:
- ‚ùì Does agent prioritize novel tasks?
- ‚ùì Does it track task novelty?
- ‚ùì Does it prefer unexplored work?

### 5. Workflow Capabilities

#### Self-Adaptation:
- ‚ùì Does agent build its own workflow?
- ‚ùì Does it adapt workflow based on task?
- ‚ùì Can it add/remove steps dynamically?

#### Playground Execution:
- ‚ùì Is there a playground/sandbox?
- ‚ùì Does agent test code before committing?
- ‚ùì Are test results shown?

### 6. Architecture Documentation

#### Architecture Creation:
- ‚ùì Does agent create architecture first?
- ‚ùì Is it saved to MD files?
- ‚ùì What files are created?

#### Review Against Architecture:
- ‚ùì Does Reviewer agent validate against architecture?
- ‚ùì Are violations reported?
- ‚ùì Is there approval workflow?

### 7. System Architecture Scan

#### After Successful Build:
- ‚ùì Does system scan final architecture?
- ‚ùì Is scan saved somewhere?
- ‚ùì Where is it stored?

#### Follow-up Requests:
- ‚ùì Is previous scan loaded?
- ‚ùì Does agent reference it?
- ‚ùì Does it speed up subsequent work?

### 8. Codesmith Special Scans

#### Tree Analysis:
- ‚ùì Does Codesmith analyze code structure?
- ‚ùì Is tree-sitter used?
- ‚ùì What information is extracted?

#### Deadcode Detection:
- ‚ùì Does Codesmith find unused code?
- ‚ùì Does it recommend cleanup?
- ‚ùì Is this shown to user?

#### Other Scans:
- ‚ùì What other analysis tools exist?
- ‚ùì Are they all used by Codesmith?

## üß™ Test Execution Plan

### Setup Phase

#### 1. Clean Installation
```bash
# Clean slate
rm -rf ~/.ki_autoagent
rm -rf ~/TestApps

# Fresh install
cd /Users/dominikfoert/git/KI_AutoAgent
./install.sh

# Update with latest code
cp -r backend/* ~/.ki_autoagent/backend/
```

#### 2. Verify Dependencies
```bash
cd ~/.ki_autoagent
venv/bin/pip check
# Expected: "No broken requirements found"
```

#### 3. Start Backend with Logging
```bash
# Start with full debug logging
~/.ki_autoagent/start.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/TestApps/backend_startup.log &

# Wait for ready
sleep 10

# Verify health
curl -s http://localhost:8001/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","workflow_ready":true}
```

### Test Phase 1: Desktop App Creation

#### Task: Timer App with Features
```
Create a Python desktop app:

Name: Focus Timer
Description: Pomodoro-style timer with task tracking

Features:
1. GUI using tkinter
2. 25-minute focus timer with 5-minute breaks
3. Task list (add/remove/complete tasks)
4. Session history (completed tasks + timestamps)
5. Statistics (total focus time, tasks completed today)
6. Save/load data from JSON
7. System tray integration (macOS)

Files to Create:
- main.py (entry point)
- timer_gui.py (GUI components)
- task_manager.py (task logic)
- session_tracker.py (history tracking)
- stats_calculator.py (statistics)
- data_persistence.py (JSON save/load)
- config.py (settings)
- README.md (full documentation)
- requirements.txt

Code Quality:
- Type hints everywhere
- Docstrings for all classes/functions
- Error handling
- Logging
- Unit tests (test_*.py files)

Architecture:
- MVC pattern
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable components
```

#### Expected Workflow:
1. Agent analyzes requirements
2. **Shows thinking:** "I need to create a desktop app..."
3. **Creates architecture:** Saves to MD file?
4. **Plans workflow:** Shows steps it will take
5. **Research:** Searches for tkinter best practices?
6. **Design:** Creates detailed design doc?
7. **Implementation:** Writes code with tool calls visible
8. **Testing:** Runs tests? Playground?
9. **Review:** Checks against architecture?
10. **Delivery:** Final summary

#### Monitoring Strategy:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend logs
tail -f ~/.ki_autoagent/logs/backend.log

# Terminal 2: Test client
python ~/TestApps/test_client.py

# Terminal 3: File watcher
watch -n 5 'find ~/TestApps/DesktopApp -type f'

# Monitor every 30 seconds:
# - What agent is doing
# - What files exist
# - What's in logs
# - What's in chat
```

### Test Phase 2: Feature Verification

#### Test Memory System:
```
# First request:
"Create a simple calculator app"

# Wait for completion, then:
"Add a history feature to the calculator you just created"

Expected:
- Agent remembers previous calculator
- Finds files from before
- Adds history without recreating everything
```

#### Test Predictive Learning:
```
Check logs for:
- "Predicting outcome..."
- "Expected: X, Got: Y"
- "Prediction error: Z"
- "Learning from error..."
```

#### Test Curiosity System:
```
# Give two tasks:
"Create either:
A) Another todo app (you've done this before)
B) A novel quantum simulation visualizer"

Expected:
- Agent chooses B (higher novelty)
- Logs show novelty calculation
```

#### Test Workflow Adaptation:
```
# Give unusual task:
"Create a real-time collaborative whiteboard with WebRTC"

Expected:
- Agent adapts workflow for this task
- Maybe adds Research step for WebRTC?
- Maybe adds Integration Test step?
- Workflow is different than simple apps
```

### Test Phase 3: Documentation Verification

#### Check Generated Files:
```bash
# After task completion:
find ~/TestApps/DesktopApp -name "*.md"

Expected files:
- ARCHITECTURE.md (system design)
- API_DESIGN.md (if applicable)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- SYSTEM_SCAN.md (after build)
- ??? (what else?)
```

#### Check Workspace Data:
```bash
ls -la ~/TestApps/DesktopApp/.ki_autoagent_ws/

Expected:
- memory/ (agent memories)
- cache/ (checksums, DB)
- artifacts/ (generated docs)
- architecture/ (scan results?)
```

### Test Phase 4: Graceful Operations

#### Test Shutdown:
```bash
# Graceful shutdown
~/.ki_autoagent/stop.sh

Expected:
- Saves state
- Closes connections
- Clean exit (no errors)
```

#### Test Restart:
```bash
# Restart
~/.ki_autoagent/start.sh

# Continue previous work
"Continue working on the Focus Timer app"

Expected:
- Agent loads previous state
- Remembers what it was doing
- Can continue seamlessly
```
