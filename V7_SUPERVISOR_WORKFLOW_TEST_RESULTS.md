## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Supervisor Pattern ✅
- **GPT-4o orchestrator** making ALL routing decisions
- **Command-based routing** (no conditional edges)
- **Dynamic instructions** for each agent
- **Confidence tracking** (0.90-1.00 range)

### 2. Agent Execution ✅
- ✅ **Research:** Perplexity search + project knowledge fallback
- ✅ **Architect:** GPT-4o architecture design
- ✅ **Codesmith:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 code generation

### 3. AI Factory v7.0 ✅
- **Multi-provider support:** OpenAI, Claude CLI, Perplexity
- **Rate limiting:** Working correctly (1-2s delays)
- **Provider switching:** Different agents use different providers

### 4. Generated Code Quality ✅

**File:** `/Users/dominikfoert/TestApps/debug_test/src/add_numbers.py`

**Code Quality: PRODUCTION-READY!**

```python
def add_numbers(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]:
    """
    Add two numbers together and return the result.

    This function takes two numeric inputs (integers or floats) and returns
    their sum. The function preserves the numeric type where possible:
    - If both inputs are integers, returns an integer
    - If either input is a float, returns a float

    Args:
        a (Union[int, float]): The first number to add
        b (Union[int, float]): The second number to add

    Returns:
        Union[int, float]: The sum of a and b

    Raises:
        TypeError: If either argument is not a number (int or float)
        ValueError: If either argument is NaN or infinite

    Examples:
        >>> add_numbers(2, 3)
        5
        >>> add_numbers(2.5, 3.7)
        6.2
    """
    # Type validation
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError(f"First argument must be a number (int or float), got {type(a).__name__}")

    if not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError(f"Second argument must be a number (int or float), got {type(b).__name__}")

    # Check for NaN and infinite values
    import math
    if isinstance(a, float) and (math.isnan(a) or math.isinf(a)):
        raise ValueError(f"First argument cannot be NaN or infinite, got {a}")

    if isinstance(b, float) and (math.isnan(b) or math.isinf(b)):
        raise ValueError(f"Second argument cannot be NaN or infinite, got {b}")

    # Perform the addition
    result = a + b

    # Return the result, preserving integer type if both inputs are integers
    if isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int):
        return result
    else:
        return float(result)
```

**Code Features:**
- ✅ **Type hints:** `Union[int, float]` (modern Python 3.10+ syntax)
- ✅ **Comprehensive docstring:** Google-style with Args, Returns, Raises, Examples
- ✅ **Error handling:** TypeError and ValueError validation
- ✅ **Edge case handling:** NaN/Inf validation
- ✅ **Type preservation:** Returns int if both inputs are int
- ✅ **Demo main():** Example usage with test cases

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. ReviewFix Agent Hanging ⚠️
**Problem:** ReviewFix gets stuck at "Running playground tests..." for 3+ minutes

**Impact:** Medium - Blocks workflow completion, but code is already generated

**Root Cause:** Playground testing subprocess appears to hang indefinitely

**Workaround:** Need to add timeout to playground testing OR skip it for simple functions

### 2. Responder Node Not Reached ❌
**Problem:** Responder doesn't route to END correctly

**Status:** Fixed in code (Responder now routes directly to END instead of supervisor)

**Verification:** Needs re-test after fixing ReviewFix

### 3. WebSocket Client Timeout ⏱️
**Problem:** Test client has 2s timeout, but workflow takes 2+ minutes

**Impact:** Low - Server continues working, but client disconnects

**Fix:** Increase client timeout to 5+ minutes for E2E tests

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Fix ReviewFix Playground Timeout**
   - Add 60s timeout to playground execution
   - Skip playground for simple single-function tasks
   - Add better error handling

2. **Verify Responder → END Routing**
   - Test that workflow completes correctly
   - Ensure response is sent to client
   - Verify WebSocket stays open until completion

3. **Increase Test Client Timeout**
   - Change from 2s to 300s (5 min)
   - Add better progress indicators
   - Show which agent is currently executing

### Testing TODO

- [ ] Run Test 2: Extend Calculator (multi-file modification)
- [ ] Run Test 3: Real-World TODO App (complex CREATE workflow)
- [ ] Run Test 4: Multi-File Project (large codebase)
- [ ] Test EXPLAIN workflow (Research → Responder only)
- [ ] Test FIX workflow (Research → Codesmith → ReviewFix → Responder)
