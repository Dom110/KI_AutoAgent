# v6 Implementation Log

**Started:** 2025-10-09
**Strategy:** Incremental iterations, live testing, commit each step

---

## Iteration 0: Baseline Test

**Goal:** Verify current v6 system works end-to-end

### Test 1: Initial Run
- ❌ Research failed: OPENAI_API_KEY not loaded
- ❌ No files created
- Issue: Server not loading .env

### Fix 1: Add dotenv loading to server
- Added `load_dotenv()` to server_v6.py
- Loads from `~/.ki_autoagent/config/.env`

### Test 2: After env loading
- ❌ Research still failed
- Issue: Perplexity tool has AUTO FALLBACK (violates requirement)
- Issue: Perplexity API not implemented (placeholder)

### Findings:
1. ✅ Server works (WebSocket, sessions)
2. ✅ Workflow initializes (Memory, Checkpointer)
3. ❌ Research needs Perplexity API implementation
4. ❌ Perplexity has auto fallback (must remove)
5. ⚠️ Workflow runs but creates no files (research blocks everything)

### Decision:
- Continue testing - workflow should work even if research fails
- Check why Codesmith didn't create files
- Likely: Empty design from Architect → Codesmith has nothing to implement

### Next: Check workflow logs to see what happened
