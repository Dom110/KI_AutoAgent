# Implementation Summary: v6.4.0-beta-asimov

## üéØ What Changed

### Core Philosophy: Asimov Rules + Agent Autonomy

**Old System (v6.3):**
- Workflow Planner creates static agent sequence
- WorkflowAwareRouter follows the plan
- Conflicts between plan and agent decisions

**New System (v6.4-asimov):**
- Agents make their own routing decisions
- Asimov Rules enforce hard constraints
- Workflow Estimator provides advisory duration/complexity only

---

## ‚úÖ Files Already Modified

### 1. **NEW: `/backend/cognitive/asimov_rules.py`**
Three Laws of KI AutoAgent:

**Rule 1: Code Safety**
- Any code change ‚Üí ReviewFix MUST run
- No code reaches production without review

**Rule 2: Architecture Documentation**
- Before workflow END ‚Üí Architect post_build_scan MUST run
- ARCHITECTURE.md is required

**Rule 3: Human Involvement**
- Confidence < 0.5 ‚Üí HITL
- Final summary ‚Üí HITL
- Human has ultimate authority

### 2. **RENAMED: `workflow_planner_v6.py` ‚Üí `workflow_estimator_v6.py`**
- Now only provides duration/complexity estimates
- Results are ADVISORY ONLY
- Does NOT dictate routing

### 3. **OBSOLETE: `/backend/cognitive/workflow_aware_router.py`**
- Marked as obsolete
- Replaced by Asimov Rules + Agent autonomous decisions

## üîß Files Still Need Updates

### Critical Files (Must Update):

#### 1. `/backend/state_v6.py`
Add new state fields:
```python
# Asimov Rules tracking
architect_modes_executed: list[str]  # Track which architect modes ran
reviewfix_iteration: int             # Track ReviewFix iterations
user_summary_shown: bool             # Track if final summary shown
asimov_rule_enforced: str | None     # Which rule was enforced

# Routing decisions
next_agent: str | None               # Agent's routing decision
routing_confidence: float            # Confidence in decision
routing_reason: str                  # Why this decision
can_end_workflow: bool               # Can workflow end now?
```

#### 2. `/backend/workflow_v6_integrated.py`
- Import AsimovRules
- Replace WorkflowPlanner with Workflow Estimator
- Simplify all routing functions to use `_route_next_agent()`
- Asimov Rules check before every routing decision

Key changes:
```python
from cognitive.asimov_rules import AsimovRules
from cognitive.workflow_estimator_v6 import WorkflowEstimator

self.asimov_rules = AsimovRules()
self.estimator = WorkflowEstimator()

def _route_next_agent(self, state, current_agent):
    # 1. Check Asimov Rules (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
    asimov_override = self.asimov_rules.enforce_all_rules(state)
    if asimov_override:
        return asimov_override["next_agent"]

    # 2. Agent's decision
    if state.get("next_agent"):
        return state["next_agent"]

    # 3. No decision ‚Üí HITL
    return "hitl"
```

#### 3. `/backend/subgraphs/architect_subgraph_v6_3.py`
Add routing decision at end:
```python
# Track modes for Asimov Rule 2
executed_modes = state.get("architect_modes_executed", [])
executed_modes.append(mode)

# Routing decision
if mode == "design":
    next_agent = "codesmith"
    routing_reason = "Architecture design complete"
    confidence = 0.95
elif mode == "post_build_scan":
    next_agent = "END"
    routing_reason = "Post-build scan complete"
    confidence = 1.0

return {
    **state,
    "next_agent": next_agent,
    "routing_confidence": confidence,
    "routing_reason": routing_reason,
    "architect_modes_executed": executed_modes,
    "can_end_workflow": (mode == "post_build_scan"),
    ...
}
```

#### 4. `/backend/subgraphs/codesmith_subgraph_v6_1.py`
Add routing decision (Asimov Rule 1 compliance):
```python
files_generated = state.get("files_generated", [])

if files_generated:
    # Asimov Rule 1: Code generated ‚Üí ReviewFix REQUIRED
    next_agent = "reviewfix"
    routing_reason = f"Code generated ({len(files_generated)} files), review required"
    confidence = 1.0
else:
    next_agent = "architect"
    routing_reason = "No code changes"
    confidence = 0.90

return {
    **state,
    "next_agent": next_agent,
    "routing_confidence": confidence,
    "routing_reason": routing_reason,
    "files_generated": files_generated,
    ...
}
```

#### 5. `/backend/subgraphs/reviewfix_subgraph_v6_1.py`
Add iteration tracking and routing:
```python
iteration = state.get("reviewfix_iteration", 0) + 1

if final_quality >= 0.85:
    next_agent = "architect"
    architect_mode = "post_build_scan"
    routing_reason = f"Review complete, quality acceptable ({final_quality})"
    confidence = 0.95
elif iteration >= 3:
    # Max iterations ‚Üí HITL
    next_agent = "hitl"
    routing_reason = f"Max iterations reached ({iteration})"
    confidence = 0.50  # Low confidence triggers HITL
else:
    next_agent = "codesmith"
    routing_reason = f"Quality low ({final_quality}), iteration {iteration}"
    confidence = 0.80

return {
    **state,
    "next_agent": next_agent,
    "architect_mode": architect_mode if next_agent == "architect" else None,
    "routing_confidence": confidence,
    "routing_reason": routing_reason,
    "reviewfix_iteration": iteration,
    "files_modified": fixed_files,
    ...
}
```

#### 6. `/backend/subgraphs/research_subgraph_v6_1.py`
Add routing decision:
```python
if mode == "research":
    next_agent = "architect"
    routing_reason = "Research findings ready for architecture"
    confidence = 0.90
elif mode in ["explain", "analyze"]:
    next_agent = "END"
    routing_reason = f"{mode.capitalize()} complete"
    confidence = 1.0

return {
    **state,
    "next_agent": next_agent,
    "routing_confidence": confidence,
    "routing_reason": routing_reason,
    "can_end_workflow": (mode in ["explain", "analyze"]),
    ...
}
```

## üìä Workflow Example

### CREATE Workflow (Todo-App):

```
1. Query Classifier: "CREATE" ‚Üí Start: Architect (design mode)

2. Architect (design):
   - Analyzes request
   - Decides: No research needed (Flask is known)
   - Creates architecture design
   - Returns: next_agent="codesmith"

3. Codesmith:
   - Generates 7 files
   - Returns: next_agent="reviewfix" (Asimov Rule 1)

4. ReviewFix (iteration 1):
   - Quality: 0.82 (< 0.85)
   - Returns: next_agent="codesmith", iteration=1

5. Codesmith:
   - Fixes code
   - Returns: next_agent="reviewfix"

6. ReviewFix (iteration 2):
   - Quality: 0.88 (>= 0.85)
   - Returns: next_agent="architect", mode="post_build_scan"

7. Architect (post_build_scan):
   - Creates ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Returns: next_agent="END"

8. Asimov Rule 2: Checks post_build_scan done ‚úÖ

9. Asimov Rule 3: Forces HITL for final summary

10. HITL:
    - Shows summary to user
    - User confirms
    - Returns: next_agent="END"

11. END
```

---

## üß™ Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests:** Test Asimov Rules individually
2. **Integration Test:** Test CREATE workflow end-to-end
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Code generated but ReviewFix skipped ‚Üí Asimov Rule 1 catches it
   - Workflow tries to end without architecture scan ‚Üí Asimov Rule 2 catches it
   - Low confidence decision ‚Üí Asimov Rule 3 triggers HITL

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. Update remaining subgraphs with routing decisions
2. Update workflow_v6_integrated.py with Asimov Rules integration
3. Update state_v6.py with new fields
4. Test CREATE workflow end-to-end
5. Write ARCHITECTURE_v6.4_ASIMOV.md documentation
6. Git commit + tag v6.4.0-beta-asimov
7. Create branch 6.4-beta

---

## üéâ Benefits

1. **Simpler:** No more conflicts between planner and router
2. **Safer:** Asimov Rules prevent quality/documentation issues
3. **Smarter:** Agents make context-aware decisions
4. **Transparent:** Every decision has a reason
5. **Flexible:** Agents can adapt dynamically
