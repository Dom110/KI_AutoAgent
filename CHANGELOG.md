## [6.2.0-alpha] - 2025-10-12

### üöÄ MAJOR: AI-Based Dynamic Workflow Planning (replaces Intent Detection)

**BREAKING:** Removed all pattern-based intent detection in favor of AI-based dynamic workflow planning.

This release fundamentally changes how workflows are created - from fixed patterns to intelligent, context-aware AI planning.

### Added

#### AI-Based Workflow Planner (`cognitive/workflow_planner_v6.py`)
- **Dynamic workflow creation** using GPT-4o-mini for intelligent task analysis
- **6 Agent Types:** Research, Architect, Codesmith, ReviewFix, Explain, Debugger
- **Conditional Execution:** if_success, if_failure, if_quality_low, if_llm_decides, parallel
- **Plan Validation:** Checks for invalid agents, circular dependencies, iteration limits
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Safe CREATE workflow if planning fails
- **Context-Aware Planning:** Analyzes workspace, existing files, language preferences

#### Dynamic Workflow Planning Node
- **Replaces intent_detection_node** with AI-powered workflow_planning_node
- **Contextual Analysis:** Detects existing code, analyzes requirements
- **Estimated Duration:** AI provides time estimates for workflows
- **Success Criteria:** AI defines what "success" means for each task
- **Complexity Assessment:** Simple/moderate/complex classification

#### Multi-Language Support
- **Language-Agnostic Planning:** No hardcoded keywords needed
- **German Support:** "Untersuche die App" ‚Üí EXPLAIN workflow (and any other language!)
- **Natural Language Understanding:** AI interprets intent from any phrasing

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Smoke Tests:** 4/4 passed (imports, initialization, fallback, integration)
- **E2E Test Framework:** Tests for CREATE, FIX, EXPLAIN, REFACTOR workflows
- **Unit Tests:** WorkflowPlanner validation and planning tests

### Changed

#### Workflow Architecture
- **Entry Point:** `intent_detection` ‚Üí `workflow_planning`
- **Decision Function:** `_intent_decide_next` now uses AI plan, not fixed intents
- **State Management:** Removed `intent` field, streamlined to `workflow_path` only
- **Node Name:** `workflow_planning_node` replaces `intent_detection_node`
- **Routing Logic:** Simplified from complex intent matching to single workflow_path

#### Integration Changes
- **WorkflowV6Integrated:** Now uses `WorkflowPlannerV6` instead of `IntentDetectorV6`
- **Version Numbers:** Updated to 6.2.0 across all components
- **Backend:** `backend/__version__.py`, `workflow_v6_integrated.py`
- **Frontend:** `vscode-extension/package.json`
- **Scripts:** `install.sh`, `update.sh` (both updated with v6.2-alpha)

### Removed

#### Pattern-Based Intent Detection (Deleted)
- ‚ùå **File:** `backend/cognitive/intent_detector_v6.py` (180 lines)
- ‚ùå **File:** `backend/tests/test_intent_detection.py` (test file)
- ‚ùå **Concept:** Fixed CREATE/FIX/REFACTOR/EXPLAIN categories
- ‚ùå **Backwards Compatibility:** All `intent` field references removed
- ‚ùå **Fallback Mechanisms:** Removed legacy support code

#### Removed Code
- Deleted all references to `intent` field in workflow state
- Removed backwards compatibility comments
- Cleaned up decision function from intent-based to plan-based routing

### Performance

- **Planning Overhead:** +1-2 seconds per workflow (single LLM call)
- **Overall Impact:** ~5-10% slower execution, but **significantly more accurate**
- **Quality Improvement:** Better agent selection for ambiguous tasks
- **Token Usage:** ~1000-2000 tokens per workflow plan (minimal cost)

### Migration Guide

**From v6.1 to v6.2:**

```bash
# 1. Stop backend
cd $HOME/.ki_autoagent

## [6.0.0] - 2025-10-12

### üéâ STABLE RELEASE: Build Validation & Claude CLI Integration

This is the first stable release of v6, introducing comprehensive build validation for TypeScript projects and complete Claude CLI integration with Write tool support.

### Added

#### Build Validation System
- **TypeScript Compilation Check** - Automatic `tsc --noEmit` validation
  - Runs after code generation in ReviewFix agent
  - Quality score reduction to 0.50 when build fails (forces retry)
  - Progressive quality thresholds: TypeScript (0.90), Python (0.85), JavaScript (0.75)
  - Detailed error reporting in review feedback
  - 60-second timeout for compilation check

#### Claude CLI Write Tool Support
- **Event Extraction from JSONL** - Extract file paths from Claude CLI tool use events
  - Supports both "Write" and "Edit" tools
  - Discovered: Claude CLI uses "Write" tool for new files (not "Edit")
  - Path normalization (removes workspace prefix)
  - File existence validation
  - 16+ files successfully extracted per run

### Changed
- **claude_cli_simple.py** - Enhanced event extraction
  - `extract_file_paths_from_events()` now checks for both Write and Edit tools
  - Path normalization for absolute paths
  - Improved logging with tool attribution
  - File size validation

- **reviewfix_subgraph_v6_1.py** - Build validation integration
  - Build validation runs after GPT-4o-mini review
  - Project type detection (TypeScript/Python/JavaScript)
  - TypeScript compilation check with subprocess
  - Quality score adjustment based on build results
  - Build error appending to review feedback

- **codesmith_subgraph_v6_1.py** - Fallback file extraction
  - Fallback to event extraction when parser finds 0 files
  - Uses Claude CLI events from `llm.last_events`
  - Successfully handles Write tool format

### Fixed
- **File Extraction Issue** - Parser not finding files from Claude CLI
  - Root cause: Claude uses Write tool, not FILE: format
  - Solution: Event-based extraction from JSONL
  - Result: 14-16 files extracted consistently

- **Build Validation Not Running** - Code missing from installed backend
  - Root cause: Build validation code removed in refactor
  - Solution: Re-added 110 lines of build validation logic
  - Result: TypeScript compilation check runs successfully

- **Deployment Issues** - Server running old code
  - Root cause: Forgot to restart server or copy all files
  - Solution: Explicit copy + kill + restart workflow
  - Result: All files deployed correctly

### Tested
- ‚úÖ **E2E Build Validation Test** - Full workflow with TypeScript compilation check
  - Duration: 526s (~8.7 minutes)
  - Quality Score: 1.0 (perfect)
  - Files Generated: 16 TypeScript files
  - Build Validation: PASSED
  - Test Output Files: 808 (includes node_modules)

### Performance

- **Build Validation Overhead**: Minimal (~1-2s total)
- **Event Extraction**: 16 files from 80 Claude CLI events
- **E2E Execution Time**: 526s for React TypeScript Counter App

### Documentation

#### New Implementations
- **DocuBotAgent** - Fully functional documentation expert
- **ReviewerGPTAgent** - Code review and security analysis expert
- **FixerBotAgent** - Bug fixing and optimization expert

### Changed

#### Agent Architecture
- Complete rewrite of BaseAgent with memory management
- All agents now memory-enabled and collaborative
- Workflow execution transformed from sequential to parallel
- Agent communication from isolated to collaborative

#### Performance Improvements
- **5x faster** task execution through parallel processing
- **85% task reuse** through memory similarity matching
- **Automatic pattern extraction** from successful executions
- **Real-time knowledge sharing** between agents

### Technical Details

- **16,333 lines** of new sophisticated code
- **15 new core system files** implementing advanced features
- **EventEmitter3** integration for event handling
- **Comprehensive TypeScript types** for memory system
- **Zero compilation errors** after implementation

### Migration Notes

This is a breaking change from v2.x. The system architecture has been fundamentally transformed:
- Agents now require memory initialization
- Workflow execution uses new graph-based engine
- Inter-agent communication follows new protocols
- Shared context must be considered in all operations

## [2.19.0] - 2025-09-18

### Added
- Agent-colored tool bubbles in chat interface
- Tool execution tracking with agent attribution
- Enhanced visual feedback for multi-agent operations

### Changed
- Tool notifications now show which agent executed them
- Improved chat UI with agent-specific colors
