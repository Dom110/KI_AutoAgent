- Performance metrics collection

### 🔧 Tool Discovery System
- Automatic tool discovery from agent methods
- `@tool` decorator for marking methods as tools
- JSON schema generation for parameters
- Tool categorization with tags
- Usage statistics tracking
- Global tool registry pattern

### ✅ Human-in-the-Loop Approval System
- Comprehensive approval request management
- Real-time WebSocket UI communication
- Configurable timeout handling
- Plan modification support
- Batch approval capabilities
- Approval history tracking
- User feedback incorporation

### 💾 Persistent Memory System
- SQLite database for long-term storage
- Optional FAISS vector search for semantic similarity
- Multiple memory types: episodic, semantic, procedural, entity
- Pattern learning and recognition
- Agent interaction history
- Memory consolidation and cleanup
- Short-term buffer management
- Session-based memory isolation

### 🔄 Dynamic Workflow Manager
- Runtime graph modification
- Add/remove nodes and edges dynamically
- Conditional routing support
- Workflow templates for reusability
- Graph visualization (Mermaid/Graphviz)
- Version control with rollback
- Template system with parameterization

### 🌐 New LangGraph Server
- FastAPI server on port 8001
- WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:8001/ws/chat`
- Health check: `/health`
- Memory statistics: `/api/memory/stats`
- Tool discovery: `/api/tools`
- Workflow visualization: `/api/workflow/visualize`

## 📦 New Dependencies

```
langgraph==0.2.45
langchain==0.3.9
langchain-core==0.3.21
langchain-openai==0.2.12
faiss-cpu==1.9.0.post1 (optional)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Workflow Implementation
- Orchestrator → Approval → Agent execution flow
- Dependency tracking between steps
- Error handling and recovery
- Step-by-step execution plan
- Agent-specific nodes (architect, codesmith, reviewer, fixer)
- Conditional edges based on execution results

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `backend/langgraph_system/` - Complete LangGraph implementation
- `backend/api/server_langgraph.py` - New FastAPI server
- `backend/test_langgraph_system.py` - Integration tests

**Modified Files:**
- `requirements.txt` - Added LangGraph dependencies
- `vscode-extension/package.json` - Version bump to 5.0.0-unstable
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated version history

## ✅ Test Results

All integration tests passing:
- ✅ State Creation
- ✅ Tool Discovery
- ✅ Persistent Memory
- ✅ Dynamic Workflow
- ✅ Workflow Execution

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Developers:
1. Update all WebSocket connections to use port 8001
2. Implement new approval request handlers in UI
3. Update message format for new state system
4. Integrate tool discovery in agents

### For Users:
1. Extension will auto-update to use new server
2. Plan-First mode now includes approval workflow
3. Enhanced memory and context retention
4. Better agent collaboration

## 🐛 Known Issues

- FAISS vector store requires OpenAI API key (optional feature)
- Checkpointer implementation simplified for initial release
- Some UI features need updates for full approval system integration

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Complete UI integration for approval system
2. Migrate all agents to use new workflow nodes
3. Implement production-ready checkpointer
4. Add comprehensive documentation
5. Performance optimization for large workflows
